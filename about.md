Hi, I'm Gayathree Gopi, an aspiring data scientist and MSBA student at UT Austin, specializing in financial and healthcare analytics. With a background in computational biology and a passion for data-driven solutions, I thrive on solving complex problems and creating impactful insights.

My experience includes analyzing $20M+ real estate investments, developing predictive models for cryptocurrencies, and researching ecological dynamics at the intersection of data science and biology. I'm excited about the potential of data to drive strategic decision-making and make a positive impact on the world.

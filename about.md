# About Me

Hello!

## I'm Gayathree

I'm an MS Business Analytics student at UT Austin, where I specialize in using data-driven techniques to solve complex financial and healthcare challenges. With a strong background in computational biology and hands-on experience in real estate investment analysis, I enjoy leveraging data science to generate impactful insights.

## My Technical Background

My journey has equipped me with a versatile set of technical skills across data science, finance, and research. At K7 Capital Partners, I analyzed multifamily real estate investments worth over $20 million, developing advanced financial models and leading data-driven strategies that achieved significant results. I've also built predictive models for cryptocurrency price forecasting using LSTM networks and conducted natural language processing projects to assess public sentiment for NASA and ISRO.

**Key Technical Skills:**
- **Programming**: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow), R, SQL
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, matplotlib, ggplot2
- **Machine Learning**: Regression models, classification, clustering, neural networks
- **Optimization & Modeling**: Gurobi, linear programming, Monte Carlo simulation
- **NLP**: spaCy, NLTK, sentiment analysis, topic modeling

I am passionate about applying these skills to real-world problems, whether itâ€™s optimizing investment portfolios, predicting market trends, or uncovering actionable insights from unstructured data.

## Beyond Data

When I'm not diving into data, I love expressing my creativity through art and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I find joy in balancing the analytical and artistic sides of my life.
